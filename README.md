1. We import a scanner to handle the user input from the keyboard therefore using the scanner class
2. We set up the coding structure by using the public static and public class which sets up the rest of the code file
3. We create a scanner called input which reads from a system.in which is used to collect all user inputs
4. We then proceed to ask it different parts of the madlib like adjectives and what not around seven times while resuing the scanner object.
5. We use the nextLine() in order to read the input and store it into a variable
6. Story generation occurs with concatenation with the fixed story text and the user input to print out the final MadLib with the help of our story template and user inputs.
